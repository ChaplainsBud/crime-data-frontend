    The Police Employee dataset  is made up of data collected annually about law enforcement officers and civilians employed by police departments. The dataset contains information about the number of officers and civilians employed and the rate of police employees per a location’s population. <br /><br />The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program defines law enforcement officers as individuals who ordinarily carry a firearm and a badge, have full arrest powers, and are paid from governmental funds set aside specifically for sworn law enforcement representatives.<br /><br />Civilian employees include personnel such as clerks, radio dispatchers, meter attendants, stenographers, jailers, correctional officers, and mechanics provided that they are full-time employees of the agency.<br /><br />Please see the UCR resources provided by the FBI for <a class="underline" href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/police-employee-data.pdf">more information on police employee data</a>.
