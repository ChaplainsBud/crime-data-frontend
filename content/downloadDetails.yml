- title: Hate Crime
  description: |
    The Hate Crime Statistics dataset provides annual statistics on the number of incidents, offenses, victims, and offenders in reported crimes that are motivated in whole, or in part, by an offender’s bias against the victim’s perceived race, gender, gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. Hate crime data is captured by including the element of bias in offenses already being reported to the UCR Program.<br /><br />All law enforcement agencies, whether they submit summary (SRS) or incident-based (NIBRS) reports, can contribute hate crime data to the UCR using forms specified to collect such information. <br /><br />Please see the UCR resources provided by the FBI for <a class="underline" href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/home">for more information on hate crime</a>. Download this dataset to see totals for hate crimes across the country from 1991–2014.
